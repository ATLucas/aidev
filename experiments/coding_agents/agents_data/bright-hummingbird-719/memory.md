I have updated the "snake.py" file by modifying the game speed logic. The previous increment of game speed after each food is eaten has been replaced with a decrement, ensuring that the game speeds up as the snake consumes more food. Additionally, I have made changes to the syntax to improve the game's performance and experience. The "snake_game" directory contains the Python script for the Snake game, with the necessary functionality and improvements.
