ASSISTANT: To update the snake game script to add the feature where the snake's speed increases every time it eats a piece of food, I need to modify the game loop to keep track of the score (or number of foods eaten) and adjust the timeout of the window accordingly.

**Plan**:
1. Introduce a new variable `speed_increase` to control how much the speed should increase every time the snake eats a piece of food.
2. Introduce a new variable `score` to keep track of how many foods the snake has eaten.
3. Update the while loop condition to check if the snake has eaten the food. If it has, I will increment the score and decrease the `w.timeout` by `speed_increase`, thus increasing the game's speed.
4. Make sure the decrease of the timeout is capped to not make the game impossibly fast.

I will now implement these changes into the script.

ASSISTANT: The user requested an update to the Snake Game script to add a feature where the snake's speed increases every time it eats a piece of food. In response, I modified the game loop to include a mechanism to update the game speed based on the number of foods eaten by the snake.

To achieve this, I introduced the `score` variable to keep track of the number of foods eaten and the `speed_increase` variable to control the speed increment. I also adjusted the timeout of the window based on the score to increase the game's speed every time the snake eats a piece of food. Additionally, I capped the minimum timeout to prevent the game from becoming impossibly fast.

The modification has been successfully implemented, and the updated script has been saved to the "snake_game.py" file in the "snake_game" directory.

Overall, the request has been fulfilled, and the necessary updates have been made to the Snake Game script.
