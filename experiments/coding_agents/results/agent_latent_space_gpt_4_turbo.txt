Assistant: 
The problem might be in the logic handling key inputs and direction changes of the snake. This could include ignoring certain key inputs or incorrectly processing them, causing the snake to only move right regardless of user input, and immediately lose when pressing left.

To fix this issue, I will first review the existing key input and direction update logic to identify the problem. Once identified, I will modify the code so that pressing up or down will correctly change the snake's direction to up or down, respectively. Pressing left should also correctly change the snake's direction to the left without causing an immediate loss.

I will now proceed to update the code accordingly.
There's a missing control structure to prevent the snake from reversing into itself, which usually causes an instant loss. For instance, if the snake is moving right, pressing the left key should be ignored since it would cause the snake to move directly into itself.

I will add this control structure, ensuring that the snake is not allowed to reverse its direction 180 degrees and thus fixing the problem with the left key causing an immediate loss. Additionally, I'll make sure the up and down controls are correctly interpreted to move the snake in the desired direction. Let's fix the code.

The script initializes the game environment, creates the snake and food, handles user input, and defines the game loop to control the movement and behavior of the snake and food. Upon review, it was found that the snake's movement is not properly handled, and it always moves to the right even if other directional keys are pressed.

Assistant: 
The update needs to modify the game loop to increase the speed of the snake each time it eats a piece of food. I will do this by:

1. Adding a variable to keep track of the snake's speed.
2. Modifying the timeout of the game window (which controls how often the screen refreshes) each time the snake eats a piece of food.

Now, I will implement these changes in the game loop section of the code.
