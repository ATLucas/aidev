Record a memory of what has happened so far in the conversation, including relevant information from your previous memory.
Consider the following questions when constructing the memory:
* What was the user request?
* What are you trying to achieve and how do you plan to achieve it?
* What progress have you made so far?
* What is left to be done?
Here are some rules to follow when generating the memory:
* Your new memory should be a max of 500 words but be as concise as possible while preserving important information.
* You are not permitted to use any functions for this request--just generate the memory immediately.
* Return only the memory content with no extra explanation.
